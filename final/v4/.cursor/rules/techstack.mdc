# Tech Stack

- **Runtime/Package Manager**: Bun
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (v4 beta via Vite plugin)
- **Graphics/Canvas**: p5.js
- **Language**: TypeScript

## Conventions

- **Package Management**: Use `bun` for all package management commands (e.g., `bun install`, `bun run dev`, `bun add`).
- **Styling**:
  - Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling HTML elements.
  - Tailwind v4 is configured via the Vite plugin (`@tailwindcss/vite`).
- **Graphics/p5.js**:
  - p5.js is used for canvas interactions.
  - Classes interacting with p5 typically accept the `p5` instance (often denoted as `p`) in their constructor to support instance mode or modularity (e.g., `constructor(p: p5)`).
  - Ensure p5 types (`@types/p5`) are leveraged for type safety.
- **File Structure**:
  - `src/classes/`: Contains logic/classes that encapsulate p5 drawing behavior.
  - `src/main.ts`: Entry point.
